// Write code to create a function that accepts a number (`n`) and returns a new number that satisfies the look-and-say-sequence

// To generate a member of the sequence from the previous member, read off the digits of the previous member, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit. 
// For example:
// 1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
// 11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
// 21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.
// 1211 is read off as "one 1, one 2, then two 1s" or 111221.
// 111221 is read off as "three 1s, two 2s, then one 1" or 312211.
